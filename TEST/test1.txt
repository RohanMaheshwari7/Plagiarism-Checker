Hello I am Rohan. This is not copied from anywhere.

PageRank is a link analysis algorithm used by the Google Internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of "measuring" its relative importance within the set. Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet; this PageRank? denotes a site’s importance in the eyes of Google.

The vector space model (also called, term vector model) is an algebraic model used to represent text documents, as well as any objects in general, as vectors of identifiers. It is used in information retrieval and was first used in the SMART Information Retrieval System.

Bayes’ theorem was names after Rev Thomas Bayes and is a method used 
in probability theory.
